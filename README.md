Idea: designing a simple voting mechanism for office trips (and miscellaneous proposals for within the organization)

Some key pointers:
1. Proposal creator provides description and options for the proposal, where different employees can vote 
2. Designing this on the Ropsten Test Network
3. Proposal creator is a role assigned to certain addresses
4. Each employee can vote only once
